# Minesweeper-copy

Complete game built with object oriented programing in JS.
This game is a copy of one of the most popular windows games.

My first purpose was to improve **JavaScript** coding skills and learn object oriented programing. Games are very good material to do this. 
In this project I use classes, inheritance and modules.

Project was created in ES6 standard. I also used experimental [private class field](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields).
